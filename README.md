Whatsapp — Front‑end Clone (HTML · CSS · JavaScript)

🚀 Project Overview

This project is a front‑end clone of a messaging‑app interface inspired by WhatsApp, created using only HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. It replicates a familiar chat‑application layout — chat list sidebar, chat windows, message bubbles, header/navigation — to simulate the look and feel of a real messaging platform. There’s no backend or real‑time messaging; the focus is purely on front‑end design, layout, and basic interactivity.

✨ Features

Responsive chat‑app layout: sidebar + chat window + header bar.

Styled message bubbles for sent and received messages.

Simulated chat switching — users can click on chats in the sidebar to view corresponding conversation windows.

Clean, semantic HTML markup and structured CSS for layout, spacing, and alignment.

Responsive design — adapts to different screen widths (desktop / mobile‑like viewports).

Basic UI interactions using JavaScript (e.g., toggling chats, rendering message bubbles).


📂 Technologies Used

HTML5 (semantic structure)

CSS3 (Flexbox / Grid, styling, responsive design)

Vanilla JavaScript (for basic front‑end interactivity)

🛠 How to Use / Run Locally

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/AbbassHazimeh/Whatsapp.git


Navigate into the project folder and open index.html in your browser.

Interact with the UI — click on chats in the sidebar to view corresponding messages.

(Optional) Modify HTML/CSS/JS to customize the style or add features.

🎯 Purpose & What I Learned

This project served as a learning exercise in front‑end development — practicing semantic HTML structure, responsive CSS design, layout management, and basic dynamic behavior with JavaScript. It helped me understand how to translate a design or mock‑up into a functional, responsive interface without using frameworks. It also reinforced core front‑end skills, which are essential for building more complex web applications in the future.


📚 Potential Improvements / Next Steps

Implement actual messaging functionality with a backend (e.g. Node.js + WebSocket) to enable real‑time chat.

Add user authentication and user profiles.

Enhance UI: show message timestamps, read status, message input box, scroll to latest message, etc.

Make the UI fully responsive across devices and screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
